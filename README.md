# AspectBasedSentimentAnalysis
This is a course project for Data Mining and Text Mining.
Implemented aspect based sentiment analysis system that parses data sets of restaurant reviews and electronic reviews from the social media websites. The system pre-processed the text data into bag-of-words representation using 5-word context window. Assigned sentiment scores to preprocessed words by taking average of sentiment scores from 5 sentiment lexicons. Used these sentiment scores for the words in context window as features to train an SVM model to predict the sentiment of a sentence. This model achieved 79% accuray among different classifiers Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines, Random Forest, Decision Tree. Technologies Used - Python, Sci-kit learn, Pandas, NLTK, TFIDF Vectorizer
